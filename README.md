# ToxNet

ToxNet is a data science group from DIRECT program at the University of Washington, which also collaborates with PNNL. The research is to predict the toxicity of various chemicals based on their structures. We utilize the published dataset from U.S Department of Health and Human Services' National Toxicology Program (https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/pubhealth/evalatm/test-method-evaluations/acute-systemic-tox/models/index.html) and convert those tabular data into image and text file applying Open-Source Cheminformatics Software [RDKit] (http://www.rdkit.org). Furthermore, we fit these different format of data into three different neural networks: RNN (text), CNN (image) and MLP (tabular). Our primary goal is to analyze whether these models provide similar prediction and if there is a model that performs consistently better than others.

### Description of Models

#### MLP

Generally, multilayer perceptron (MLP) performs well to train the tabular form of data. We adopted this strategy for our project. In this network, we tuned the hyperparameters including dropout rate, number of layers, activation function (relu_type), number of nodes per layer, regulization type and regulization value.

|               | dropout rate | number of layer | relu_type | Nodes | regulization | regulization value |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------------| ----------| ----- | ------------ | ------------------ |

|    verytoxic  |
|    GHS        |
|    EPA        |
|    LD50       |
